  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: create_private_dns_namespace(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a private namespace based on DNS, which will be visible only inside a specified Amazon VPC. The namespace defines your service naming scheme. For example, if you name your namespace ``example.com`` and name your service ``backend`` , the resulting DNS name for the service will be ``backend.example.com`` . You can associate more than one service with the same namespace.

    :type DnsConfig: dict
    :param DnsConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A complex type that contains information about the resource record sets that you want Amazon Route 53 to create when you register an instance. 

      

    
      - **NamespaceId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.

        

      
      - **DnsRecords** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each resource record set that you want Amazon Route 53 to create when you register an instance.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains information about the resource record sets that you want Amazon Route 53 to create when you register an instance.

          

        
          - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The type of the resource, which indicates the value that Amazon Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries. The following values are supported:

             

             
            * **A** : Amazon Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44. 
             
            * **AAAA** : Amazon Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. 
             
            * **SRV** : Amazon Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses the following template, which can't be changed:  ``priority weight port resource-record-set-name``   The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to 1. The value of port comes from the value that you specify for ``Port`` when you submit a  RegisterInstance request. 
             

            

          
          - **TTL** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this resource record set.

            

          
        
    
    
    :type HealthCheckConfig: dict
    :param HealthCheckConfig: 

       *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Amazon Route 53 associates the health check with all the resource record sets that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .

       

      .. note::

         

        The health check uses 30 seconds as the request interval. This is the number of seconds between the time that each Amazon Route 53 health checker gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. A health checker in each data center around the world sends your endpoint a health check request every 30 seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a health check request about every two seconds. Health checkers in different data centers don't coordinate with one another, so you'll sometimes see several requests per second followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all.

         

       

      For information about the charges for health checks, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing>`__ .

      

    
      - **Type** *(string) --* 

        The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

         

        .. warning::

           

          You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

           

         

        You can create the following types of health checks:

         

         
        * **HTTP** : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 
         
        * **HTTPS** : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 

        .. warning::

           If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later. 

         
         
        * **TCP** : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. 
         

         

        For more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        

      
      - **ResourcePath** *(string) --* 

        The path that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, such as the file ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` . Amazon Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service and a leading forward slash (``/`` ) character. 

        

      
      - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 

        The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

Amazon Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service and a leading forward slash (``/`` ) character. 

              
            

            - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 

              The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

              
        
          

          - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time that the service was created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

            
          

          - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --* 

            An optional parameter that you can use to resolve concurrent creation requests. ``CreatorRequestId`` helps to determine if a specific client owns the namespace.

            
      
    

  .. py:method:: delete_namespace(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes a namespace from the current account. If the namespace still contains one or more services, the request fails.

          - **DnsConfig** *(dict) --* 

            A complex type that contains information about the resource record sets that you want Amazon Route 53 to create when you register an instance.

            
            

            - **NamespaceId** *(string) --* 

              The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.

              
            

            - **DnsRecords** *(list) --* 

              An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each resource record set that you want Amazon Route 53 to create when you register an instance.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A complex type that contains information about the resource record sets that you want Amazon Route 53 to create when you register an instance.

                
                

                - **Type** *(string) --* 

                  The type of the resource, which indicates the value that Amazon Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries. The following values are supported:

                   

                   
                  * **A** : Amazon Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44. 
                   
                  * **AAAA** : Amazon Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. 
                   
                  * **SRV** : Amazon Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses the following template, which can't be changed:  ``priority weight port resource-record-set-name``   The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to 1. The value of port comes from the value that you specify for ``Port`` when you submit a  RegisterInstance request. 
                   

                  
                

                - **TTL** *(integer) --* 

                  The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this resource record set.

                  
            
          
        
          

          - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --* 

             *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Amazon Route 53 associates the health check with all the resource record sets that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .

             

            .. note::

               

              The health check uses 30 seconds as the request interval. This is the number of seconds between the time that each Amazon Route 53 health checker gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. A health checker in each data center around the world sends your endpoint a health check request every 30 seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a health check request about every two seconds. Health checkers in different data centers don't coordinate with one another, so you'll sometimes see several requests per second followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all.

               

             

            For information about the charges for health checks, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing>`__ .

            
            

            - **Type** *(string) --* 

              The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

               

              .. warning::

                 

                You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

                 

               

              You can create the following types of health checks:

               

               
              * **HTTP** : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 
               
              * **HTTPS** : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 

              .. warning::

                 If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later. 

               
               
              * **TCP** : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. 
               

               

              For more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

              
            

            - **ResourcePath** *(string) --* 

              The path that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, such as the file ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` . Amazon Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service and a leading forward slash (``/`` ) character. 

              
            

            - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 

              The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

              
        
          

          - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time that the service was created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

            
          

          - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --* 

            An optional parameter that you can use to resolve concurrent creation requests. ``CreatorRequestId`` helps to determine if a specific client owns the namespace.

  .. py:method:: register_instance(**kwargs)

    

    Creates one or more resource record sets and optionally a health check based on the settings in a specified service. When you submit a ``RegisterInstance`` request, Amazon Route 53 does the following:

     

     
    * Creates a resource record set for each resource record set template in the service 
     
    * Creates a health check based on the settings in the health check template in the service, if any 
     
    * Associates the health check, if any, with each of the resource record sets 
     

     

    .. warning::

       

      One ``RegisterInstance`` request must complete before you can submit another request and specify the same service and instance ID.

       

     

    For more information, see  CreateService .

     

    When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for the specified DNS name, it returns the applicable value:

     

     
    * **If the health check is healthy** : returns all the resource record sets

              The type of the resource, which indicates the value that Amazon Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries. The following values are supported:

               

               
              * **A** : Amazon Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44. 
               
              * **AAAA** : Amazon Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. 
               
              * **SRV** : Amazon Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses the following template, which can't be changed:  ``priority weight port resource-record-set-name``   The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to 1. The value of port comes from the value that you specify for ``Port`` when you submit a  RegisterInstance request. 
               

              

            
            - **TTL** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this resource record set.

              

            
          
      
      
      - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --* 

         *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Amazon Route 53 associates the health check with all the resource record sets that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .

         

        .. note::

           

          The health check uses 30 seconds as the request interval. This is the number of seconds between the time that each Amazon Route 53 health checker gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. A health checker in each data center around the world sends your endpoint a health check request every 30 seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a health check request about every two seconds. Health checkers in different data centers don't coordinate with one another, so you'll sometimes see several requests per second followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all.

           

         

        For information about the charges for health checks, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing>`__ .

        

      
        - **Type** *(string) --* 

          The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

           

          .. warning::

             

            You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

             

           

          You can create the following types of health checks:

           

           
          * **HTTP** : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 
           
          * **HTTPS** : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 

          .. warning::

             If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later. 

           
           
          * **TCP** : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. 
           

           

          For more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          

        
        - **ResourcePath** *(string) --* 

          The path that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, such as the file ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` .
